- React apps are made out of components.
    - components piece of UI that has its own logic and appearance
        - can be as small as a button or as large as an entire space
- code sample
---- component
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>
      I'm a button
    </button>
  );
}
---- component
export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}

- export default keywords specify main component in the file
- The markup syntax you’ve seen above is called JSX. It is optional, but most React projects use JSX for its convenience.
- JSX is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like <br />. Your component also can’t return multiple JSX tags. 
You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a <div>...</div> or an empty <>...</> wrapper:

- React does not prescribe how you add CSS files. In the simplest case, you’ll add a <link> tag to your HTML.
- JSX lets you put markup into JavaScript. Curly braces let you “escape back” into JavaScript so that you can 
embed some variable from your code and display it to the user
- style={{width: user.imageSize,height: user.imageSize}}
